## Local Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:

### 3. Setup Supabase
1. Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com) and create a new project.
2. In your Supabase dashboard, go to the SQL Editor.
3. Copy the contents of `database.sql` (found in the root of this project) and run it in the SQL Editor to create the tables, RLS policies, and seed data.
4. Set up an Admin user by creating an account via the Supabase Authentication UI in the dashboard.
